--The hostname is a simple name to give to your Raspberry Pi (or any computer)
	so you can easily recognize it. The hostname also shows up on your command
	prompt so you know what system you are on.
	
--The hostname should be short and only consist of letters, numbers and hyphen (-)
	Please note: RFCs mandate that a hostname's labels may contain 
	only the ASCII letters 'a' through 'z' (case-insensitive),
	the digits '0' through '9', and the hyphen.
	Hostname labels cannot begin or end with a hyphen.
	No other symbols, punctuation characters, or blank spaces are
	permitted.

--Many users create a theme for their network and name their systems (computers)
	accordingly. Others use more conventional names like purpose or user based.
	Here are some ideas to get you started
	
	THEME - Greek Gods
		IE: Zues, Apollo, Nemesis, Athene, Hermes, Aphrodite
		
	THEME - User Based / Purpose
		IE: Mom, Dad, Dad-Laptop, GardenPi, IOT-DoorWatch
